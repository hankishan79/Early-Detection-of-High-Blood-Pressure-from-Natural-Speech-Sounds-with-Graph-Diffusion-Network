This study presents an innovative approach to cuffless blood pressure prediction by integrating speech and demographic features. With a focus on non-invasive monitoring, especially in remote regions, our model harnesses speech signals and demographic data to accurately estimate blood pressure. We found a strong correlation between our predictive model and early-stage high blood pressure, highlighting its potential for early detection. Central to our investigation is the Gradient Boosting Regressor based Ensemble Late Fusion (GBR-F) model, achieving exceptional performance with an R2 score of 0.999 and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 1.0. Leveraging speech-based features and demographic variables, our model offers a convenient, real-time solution for blood pressure monitoring, bypassing traditional cuff-based devices. Our findings not only advance digital health by providing accessible monitoring techniques but also underscore the potential of speech analysis in healthcare beyond its traditional applications.
