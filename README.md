This study presents a comprehensive investigation into the development of a cuffless blood pressure prediction model that combines speech and demographic features. The motivation behind this model arises from the need for non-invasive and easily accessible methods for blood pressure monitoring, particularly in remote and underserved areas. By harnessing the inherent characteristics of speech signals and leveraging demographic information, the proposed model offers an innovative approach to accurately estimate blood pressure. The focal point of our analysis is the Gradient Boosting regressor based Ensemble Late Fusion (GBR-F) model, which achieves remarkable performance with a high R2 score of 0.9835 and a strong Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9945. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach in accurately predicting blood pressure values. By utilizing speech-based features, such as vocal characteristics and articulatory patterns, in combination with relevant demographic variables, the model can provide a convenient and real-time solution for individuals to monitor their blood pressure without the need for traditional cuff-based devices. The findings of this study hold significant implications for the field of digital health, as they contribute to the advancement of accessible and remote blood pressure monitoring techniques. Furthermore, this research demonstrates the untapped potential of speech analysis in healthcare applications beyond traditional speech recognition and natural language processing tasks.
